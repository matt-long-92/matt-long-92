          Matt is fair and cool headed when communicating views while also getting
          to the point, especially during pressurised situations. Matt keeps an
          open mind towards solutions, depending on the needs of the project. I've
          enjoyed working with Matt.

          I am honestly sad to see Matt move on, but I hope he thrives wherever he
          goes next :). Matt is really nice and easy to talk to. I enjoyed the
          presentations Matt delivered to show the various new things he has
          implemented (DataDog Observability, CDK IaC) into our systems and he has
          made serious improvements to the company as a whole, in a short space of
          time. He has left his mark for sure and he will definitely be missed :)

          I like working with Matt.  I really appreciate that Matt is willing to
          share details about his projects. He is clearly a team player who is
          searching for the solutions. Also, the best part is that he is
          transparent, I feel like I can trust Matt.

          I’ve seen how well Matt applies his deep knowledge of existing systems
          to new problems, and if the issue can’t be resolved immediately with an
          existing implementation, I’m always confident Matt will find out the
          answer some way or another. Matt is a lovely guy, who has a lot of offer
          both professionally, and personally.

          Matts help has always been crucial. Here are a few examples: * Giving me
          access to various services. * Providing an DevOps-oriented overview. *
          Setting up environments. On each occasion, he was incredibly responsive
          and thorough. Let me further elaborate on those! Whenever I had a
          request, I always got a response remarkably quickly. Even if you needed
          more time to do the thing, I knew my request was “in the queue”. Of
          course, Matt also provided every necessary update regarding the progress
          and the completion of the task. I’d also like to underline your
          thoroughness. Citing examples, one that comes into my mind is how you
          always ask questions: “Why do you want to do this?“. You’re trying to
          understand the problem to give the best possible solution. Another
          example that comes to my mind is the accounting pipeline project. You
          went the extra mile to explain how to operate the AWS queue thoroughly,
          so any engineer can troubleshoot it, even if they did not take part in
          implementing the new accounting solution. Working with Matt has always
          been a pleasure for me, as your knowledge is unquestionable, and you’re
          always there to help.

          My experience working with Matt has been positive since day 1. I
          remember when I joined Matt was responsive, made me feel welcome, and
          helped with several questions I had. Matt always helps other joiners
          throughout. Matts contributions to the execution team overall have been
          significant. Matt is a team player and always meets deadlines. In
          particular, Matt did a great job supporting all monetization projects
          (especially the last one which wasn't well scoped and was needed just
          before code freeze). Matt can certainly lead and own projects and can
          document well technical details. I have nothing negative to say, it's
          been a pleasure working with Matt!

        <p style="width: 50%">
          I really enjoyed working with Matt, especially on these last few
          projects. I like the way Matt explain things, and he is really thorough
          with his work. I really appreciated his detailed responses any time I
          had a question. Having engineers who know how to explain their
          solutions, questions and reasonings is a really valuable skill. I even
          think it’s something that can separate a good engineer from a great one,
          and I really got that feeling from Matt. Plus, I really like your Matts
          “positive, can-do” attitude. He says it like it is, and it’s really
          refreshing to hear something like that in today’s industry

          proficiency contributing to and leading numerous DevOps initiatives.

          very approachable on a personal level.

          During my time working with Matt I found him to be very approachable -
          as a new developer, he was a great mentor with a knack for explaining
          complex topics in an accessible way.

          A great asset to the team, Matt is excellent to work with, extremely
          knowledgable and always furthering his understanding of technologies.
          Matts wholistic understanding and ability really shines through when
          working with him; seeing him apply knowledge to complete tasks with
          speed, all the while maintaining a high standard of quality and best
          practices, is a great example of how a Software Engineer should be.
          Knowledge transfer within the team is a strong point for Matt,
          especially when mentoring less experienced team members. Understanding
          of technologies and frameworks is shared by Matt, to whoever he works
          with or helps. Matt is a great team player.
